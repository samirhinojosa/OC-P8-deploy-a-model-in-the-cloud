# Deploy a model in the cloud  [OC-P8]

## **Problem to solve**


You are Data Scientist in a very young Start-up of Agritech, named **"Fruits!"**, who seeks to offer innovative solutions for the harvest of fruits.

The willingness of the company is to preserve the biodiversity of fruits by allowing specific treatments for each species of fruits by developing intelligent gatherer robots.

Your start-up now wishes to be known by providing the general public a mobile application that would allow users to take a fruit and obtain information about this fruit.

For the start-up, this application would make it possible to raise awareness of fruit biodiversity and set up a first version of the fruit image classification engine.

In addition, the development of the mobile application will build a first version of the necessary Big Data architecture.

## **Your mission**

Develop in a Big Data environment a first data processing chain that will include the preprocessing and a step of dimension reduction.

### **Considerations - Dashboard specifications**

You will need to consider in your developments because the data volume will increase very quickly after delivery of this project. 

- Develop Pyspark scripts and use the Cloud AWS for example to enjoy a Big Data (EC2, S3, IAM) architecture, based on an EC2 Linux server.
- The implementation of a Big Data architecture (for example) AWS may require a more powerful server configuration than that offered for free (EC2 = T2.Micro, 1 GB RAM, 8 GB server disk).
